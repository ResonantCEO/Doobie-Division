-- Add staff role support
-- This migration doesn't need to alter the table structure since roles are stored as varchar
-- Just documenting the new role option

-- The role field already supports any varchar value
-- Valid roles are now: customer, staff, manager, admin

-- No structural changes needed, just documentation
SELECT 1; -- Placeholder query
